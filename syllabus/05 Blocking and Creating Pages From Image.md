05 - Blocking and Creating Pages From Images
===============

> A common duty of a front end developer is to take designs and translate them to code. This week we will learn where to start, how to block out the page (prepare it for development) and then customize. 

***

### Create your project folders
> Prepare your environment to support the new files and folders. Set up your initial index.html file in the root. 

- /css
- /img
- /js
- /index.html

### Design Review and Planning 
> Before you do anything in code, you have to create a plan for developing the site. Planning correctly will prevent you from having to rework code later and will ensure that you build the site to look as close to the original design. Think of a house being built. When you pass by it in its early stages, you see framing and the base structure. Over time, you will see it become a beautiful home.

### Blocking 
> The important thing to remember is that every design can, and should, be broken into its most simple components (shapes and space assignments). If you block items out, you can build the base components out before you worry about the design specifics. If you use a "mobile first" strategy, this is a huge benefit.

### Add customization
> Once your blocking is complete, you take each blocked row and add CSS and images to style. This is where you begin to see the house begin to take shape and eventually become that beautiful design.
