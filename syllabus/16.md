# Animate.css

### Objective

* Implement Animate.css library into their project
* How to trigger animation using jQuery

### Animate.css

This is a CSS library full with animation for us to use. It is very simple to add to your project and to the elements on your page.

Go to [https://raw.github.com/daneden/animate.css/master/animate.css](https://raw.github.com/daneden/animate.css/master/animate.css) to download the CSS library.

According to the [documentation](https://github.com/daneden/animate.css) you'd need to add the class `animated`and the animation you want to add. You can also add `infinite` but it's optional.

#### Example

A h1 element bouncing only once.
```html
<h1 class="animated bounce">Example</h1>

```

A h1 element bouncing all the time.
```html
<h1 class="animated bounce infinite">Example</h1>
```

> The order in wich you add the classes does not affect the result but its good practice to start with `animated`, `effect`, and `infinite` if necessary.


Go to [http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/](http://daneden.github.io/animate.css/) to see all the available effects.

### jQuery - How to trigger animation when scrolling

Even though this class does not cover JavaScript at all, we are going to use some JavaScript and jQuery code to trigger the animations when we are scrolling down the page.

Before we even start writing code we need to incorporate jQuery into our page. There are two ways of doing it - using [CDN](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Content_delivery_network) or as a local file like `js/jquery.min.js`.

#### CDN

There are many places and versions that you can get jQuery. Make sure you are using the one is going to work with `Bootstrap`.

`<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.3/jquery.min.js"></script>`

#### Download

You can download the compressed (minified) version of jQuery and add it to your `js folder`.

Go to [http://jquery.com/download/](http://jquery.com/download/) and click on `Download the compressed, production jQuery 1.11.3`. Save the code in a new file. I recommend you name it `jquery.1.11.3.min.js` so you know the version and that is minified.

> Notice how the CDN and download version are both 1.11.3

#### Script

Create a new js file into your `js folder` and name it `animation-scroll.js` and add it to your project like so:

```html
<!-- JS Libraries -->
<script src="js/jquery.1.11.3.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/bootstrap.min.js"></script>
<script src="js/animation-scroll.js"></script>
```

> It is important that you follow the order in which the js files are added or it won't work.

Paste the following code on to `animation-scroll.js`

```js
$(document).ready(function () {

    $(window).scroll(function() {
    
    
    });
});
```
