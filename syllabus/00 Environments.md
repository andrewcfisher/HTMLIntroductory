Environment Setup & Code Editor
===============

Setting up your local environment

These are instructions for setting up a local environment to build websites. If you set this up, you will have the ability to build and test your personal projects without needing internet access. 

Applications
In order to build a local environment quickly, I have selected the following application to get you started. As you develop your skills, you may find other applications that fit your style. 

<a href='http://brackets.io/'>Brackets is a lightweight, yet powerful, modern text editor.</a> 


<strong>Create a folder for all your projects</strong> 
Be sure to create a folder on your computer that will have all your projects in it. Be sure to account, not just for 1, but for a number of projects. I would create the following folder structure to start:

"/{user}/documents/AustinCodingAcademy/"

If you add more projects, add them all to the "AustinCodingAcademy" folder. When you are done, you will have an organized folder structure like this...

/documents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/AustinCodingAcademy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/project1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/project2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/project3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>


<strong>Setting up Brackets</strong>
Once Brackets is installed i woudl recommend you to install the following extensions:
    <ul>
        <li>Beautify - Format JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.</li>
        <li>Code Folding - Brace folding, tag folding, indent folding and multi-line comment folding.</li>
        <li>Themes for Brackets - A theme-pack that styles the whole editor.</li>
    </ul>
