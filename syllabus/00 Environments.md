<h1>Environment Setup & Code Editor<h1>

<h2>Setting up your local environment</h2>

These are instructions for setting up a local environment to build websites. If you set this up, you will have the ability to build and test your personal projects without needing internet access. 

<h3>Code Editor</h3>
What I would like you do to is to install <a href='http://brackets.io/'>Brackets</a> on your machine (Mac or Windows). The installation is pretty straight forward. Once the installation is completed and run brackets for the first time it would look something like this:
    ![Brackets](/images/brackets.JPG)

Once Brackets is installed i would recommend you to install the following extensions:
    <ul>
        <li>Beautify - Format JavaScript, HTML, and CSS files.</li>
        <li>Code Folding - Brace folding, tag folding, indent folding and multi-line comment folding.</li>
        <li>Themes for Brackets - A theme-pack that styles the whole editor.</li>
    </ul>

Here is an example on how to install the "Beautify" extension:

<h3>Folder structure</h3>
To ensure we all are in the same page, I would like you to follow the folder structure I present, this is not required but it would help me and you on the long run. In your documents folder create another folder and name it "AustinCodingAcademy."

If you add more projects, add them all to the "AustinCodingAcademy" folder. When you are done, you will have an organized folder structure like this:

/documents<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/AustinCodingAcademy<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/project1<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/project2<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;/project3<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...<br>

> It is important to note that these folder are named as an example just like the numbers of folder that "AustinCodingAcedemy" will have.

<h3>Adding a project folder to Brakets</h3>
Now that we have Brackets installed and the folder structured, we are going to add one of the project folder on the sidebar. This will allows to access files and folders within the project easily.
