# Bootstrap Navigation

### Objective

* Implement Bootstrap Navigation
* Be able to change properties of the navigation as needed
* Work on in-class exercises

### Navigation

We will be using the Bootstrap responsive navigation menu. Bootstrap website has an example but I find it a bit complex to understand and it has more than what we need in our project, so I came with a `simpler` version of the navigation that we will be using in our project; take a look:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
    <div class="container">
        <div class="navbar-header">
            <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#example-navbar-collapse">
                <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
            </button>
            <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand</a>
        </div>

        <!-- Collect the nav links for toggling -->
        <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="example-navbar-collapse">
            <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
            </ul> 
        </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
    </div><!-- /.container -->
</nav>
```
There are several containers and classes that bootstrap uses. Don't worry too much about understanding every single one of them, just know the basics of how it works.

For this navigation to work it is necessary that you include your Bootstrap CSS file, jQuery and Bootstrap JS files.

### Exercise/Homework

We are going to redo the Winery website but this time we are going to implement the navigation using the code above. The rest of the site has to be done using Bootstrap grid system and it has to respond to laptop, tablet, and phone viewports.

Here is the original website I used for exercise on [day 7](07-08.md#homework). It is a responsive site. I want you to implement the navigation, hero, two columns, 2nd hero (without parallax), three columns (wine bottles). Don't redo the entire site, unless you are fast enough to have done by Wednesday.

All the images, color, and font are in the site. Use the developer tool to get the details. Communicate with your peers using Slack and exchange information if needed.
