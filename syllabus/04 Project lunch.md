# Project Lunch

Finally after going through the core concepts we are ready to start building our first website. We will start from scratch, create folder structure, adding HTML and CSS files, and start writing the code.

It is very important that you have already choose a theme: organization, company, or personal site. Gather as much information and pictures as you can, they will help us to create the website. Having real content instead of using lorem ipsum and gray images makes a difference on the final product.

## Project Structure

We will not be using any framework yet, we will put in practice the core concepts of HTML and CSS we've learn and see for ourselves of what we are capable of. This is going to be very exciting.

The project will be structure having the following format:

### Menu

The menu will consist on the name of the organization/company/product you have chosen and four links to different sections on the page. So think of at least 4 different element you want to add to your website.

### Section

Each section of your organization/company/product will include the content you collected. The order of each section is irrelevant but I'd recommend to al least have the landing section first as a big impression when a person visit the page.

#### Landing section

Here we will be adding a picture of the organization/company/product, along with a title, subtitle and a button. The idea is to in a few words tell what the organization/company/product is all about.

#### Welcome/About section

In this section we will be adding more information to the visitor about the organization/company/product that could not be address in the landing page. We are going to use a single image and maybe two or three paragraphs.
 
#### Column section

Here we are going to describe or extend the benefits of using a product, programs that a organization has, or the main characteristics of the company you choose.

#### Event/Activities

The main purpose of this section is to invite the visitor to assist or participate on one or more activities the company is offering to the community.

#### Call to Action

Call to action is a term used for elements in the website that requires the user interaction. The most common are buttons (e.g. "Buy it Now!") or leads to a web page with additional information (e.g. "Donate" or "Learn more...")
