# Project Lunch

Now that we have covered the core concepts, we are ready to start building our first website. We will start from scratch, create a folder structure, add HTML and CSS files, and start writing the code.

It is very important that you choose a site type: organization, company, or personal site. Gather as much information and images as you can; they will help us to create the website. Having real content instead of using lorem ipsum and gray images makes a difference on the final product.

## Project Structure

We will not start out with a particular framework; we will instead put into practice the core concepts of HTML and CSS we've learned and see for ourselves of what can be done. This is going to be very exciting!

The project will be structured with the following format:

### Menu

The menu will consist of the name of the organization/company/product you have chosen and four links to different sections on the page. So think of at least 4 different elements you want to add to your website.

### Section

Each section of your organization/company/product will include the content you collected. The order of each section is irrelevant but I'd recommend having the landing section first as it will serve as a first impression when a person visits the page.

#### Landing section

Here we will be adding a picture of the organization/company/product, along with a title, subtitle and a button. The idea is to in a few words tell what the organization/company/product is all about.

#### Welcome/About section

In this section we will be adding more information to the visitor about the organization/company/product that could not be addressed on the landing page. We are going to use a single image and maybe two or three paragraphs.
 
#### Column section

Here we are going to describe the benefits of using a product, provide a brief synopsis of the programs that an organization has, or highlight the main services of the company you choose.

#### Events/Activities

The main purpose of this section is to showcase events or activities the company or organization is offering to the community.

#### Call to Action

Call to action is a term used for elements in the website that require user interaction. The most common are buttons (e.g. "Buy it Now!") or leads to a web page with additional information (e.g. "Donate" or "Learn more...").
