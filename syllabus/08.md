# Instruction Plan

### Engage

Imagine that for some reason your laptop stops working and you have not made any backup. What if you are working on a file 
and you make a huge mistake and can't go back enough to when it was working. Those two scenarios are a nightmare. 
Gladly there is smart solution to that; `GitHub`.

The webpages you have created so far can only be seen on your computer because your files are local. Wouldn't be awesome to
give someone a url and show what we are capable of doing? When you signed up to GitHub yu gain the change to make that
possible.

### Explore

Take a look to some of these projects hosted on GitHub
* http://kikolio.github.io/
* http://ericaabadu.github.io/

### Explain/Elaborate

Head over [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/) and let's follow the steps described there:

* Create a repository - Make sure is named username.github.io, where **username** is your username on GitHub.
* Clone your repository using GitHub App
* Create an index.html file
* Lastly, commit and sync
* Fire up a browser and go to http://username.github.io.

### Evaluate

In your project create a README.md file explaining what is your webpage about, what technology you will be using, and the reason you choose that organization/company to work with. Then commit your changes and sync. Go to [GitHub](http://github.com) and check your changes.

Start working on your project. Make sure you have at least the following items:
* Have your index.html
* Have a css and img folder - if the folder is empty it wont sync so dont worry if you dont see a folder yet.
* Add the CSS reset to the project and link it to your index page
* Add your CSS style file to the project and link it to your index page
* Add a link to the font you are planning on using from Google Fonts

**Commit to those changes and make sure everything is linked correctly.**

#### Wireframe

We are going to work together using this wireframe as a reference. You need to use text and images that represent the company/organization you selected.
