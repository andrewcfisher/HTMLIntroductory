# Instruction Plan

### Engage

Imagine that for some reason your laptop stops working and you have not made any backup. What if you are working on a file 
and you make a huge mistake and can't go back enought to when it was working. Those two scenarios are a nightmare. 
Gladly there is smart solution to that; `GitHub`.

The webpages you have created so far can only be seen on your computer because your files are local. Wouldn't be awesome to
give someone an url and show what we are capable of doing? When you signed up to GitHub yu gain the change to make that
possible.
