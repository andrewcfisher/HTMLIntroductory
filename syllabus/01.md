# HTML - HyperText Markup Language

### Objective
Create your first website using the most basic HTML elements.

### Prereading
Read about HTML5 and HTML elements. http://www.w3schools.com/html/default.asp 

# Intructional Plan

### Engage

We navigate the Internet all the time but most of us never think about how those websites are built or how the browser interprets the information coming from the servers (computers that are on all the time). If we are curious enough we can see the source of a website and realize that pretty much everything is just plain text. But how is that possible when we see everything structured, colored, styled, and in place?  

We can learn to tell the browser how to display information. By learning HTML, we can learn to control the look of a webpage. We will also learn CSS and look at JavaScript, but those two would not exist if there wasnâ€™t any structure and a way to present information to the user. 

### Explore

Visit your favorite website and look at its source - What HTML elements do you see? What else do you see?

Make changes to certain elements and see what happens to the page.

### Explain

You can input plain text and the browser is going to display it, but we all know that a website is much more than just text and even the text itself is organized and in place. In order for us to structure the content, we need to use HTML elements. These elements will define how the content will be displayed because the browser or user agent knows how to interpret them. 

Let's take a look at one of the many HTML elements. Here is an example of a p element used to have a paragraph.

Now that we know generally how most HTML elements should look, [here](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp) is a list of the most common HTML elements you will find in a website and with which you need to familiarize yourself since you will often be using them. 

Now, let's create a three paragraph by using the <p> element and fill them with some text. Notice how each paragraph behave with each other.

```html
<p>I cannot believe I am telling the browser what to do. I got to be pretty smart!</p>
```
There are some other elements that require more information in order to work. That information is called `attribute`. For example an image element does not have a closing tag and needs two attributes `src` that stands for source and `alt` alternative text that is displayed in case the image does not load. 

```html
<img src="url or path to the image" alt="Toon Link"/>
```
