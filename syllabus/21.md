# Extra Learning Round 2

### Objective

* Learn about Github some more
* Finish up the presentation
* Install a twitter widget
* Learn a bit about APIs

## Twitter Widget

Go here:  [https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170071](https://support.twitter.com/articles/20170071) 
Make sure you're signed in to twitter, because we'll be making a feed from your account. 


## API

Application Programming Interface. Software to software interaction that allows developers to utilize software made available to them. For example, google maps. Type or go to the following address:  [http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=chicago&server=false](http://maps.googleapis.com/maps/api/geocode/json?address=chicago&server=false).

Cool! Look at all that information, just sitting there. Let's take the lat and long and use it with another app! Like instagram.

go to [https://www.instagram.com/developer/deprecated/api-console/](https://www.instagram.com/developer/deprecated/api-console/)

You'll have to be logged in to access this and then ask for permission to access their API. After you have access, go to full screen on the apigee app.

Select the service, then go down to media/search. Enter in the following info:
Lat = 41.87
Long = -87.62
Distance = 20

Now there's some more data! Let's grab a random picture and hope it's not profane! 

Once you learn more about JSON files, you'll be able to access and use information from hundreds of apps. It's a really great field to get into.
