# Instruction Plan

### Engage

HTML elements help us to structure the content on the page, grouping it semantically, but that isn't enough by itself. We need CSS to make our pages more attractive and pleasing to the eye by controlling HTML elements with regard to position, color, and size. CSS allows us to create rules that specify the element we want to target and the set of properties that are applied to that element.

### Explore

Visit any website of your preference and open the developer tool. Inspect any element you want. Notice that in the developer tool right panel there is a list of CSS rules that are being applied to the element selected. You can turn the declarations on and off by toggling the checkbox next to it.

What properties do you see?
What values do you see for those properties? Make some changes to those values, what happens after?

### Explain

CSS needs three components to work. A selector, properties and values. The `selector` will tell CSS what is going to be changed. The `declaration` tells what `properties` are going to change and the `value` tells to what is going to change.

First example showing in file CSS affecting a p element
```html
<style>
    p {
    font-size: 20px;
    color: blue;
}
</style>

<p>This paragraph will be affected by the CSS rule above, giving a font size of 20 pixels and blue text color.</p>
```

There are three ways to write CSS for a webpage. We have `in-line style`, within the `same file` using style, and `external file`. Let's take a look to each one of them and see which one is the best solution for us.

#### In-line style
Basically this involves adding an attribute `style` with `declarations` as values. This way of writing CSS does not require `selector`.

```html
<section style="width: 500px; height: 256px; background:#ccc;">Seccions work just like div but they have semantic meanin</section>
```

#### Same file
It is done by adding a `<style>` element preferably within the `<head>` element. Inside `<style>` CSS rules can be written.

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Adding CSS using style element</title>
        <style>
            h1 {
                text-decoration: underline;
                font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
            }
        </style>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.</h1>
    </body>
</html>

```

#### External CSS File
This is the most common and smart way of integrating CSS since it can be shared with several HTML pages and one change can affect all pages that use it, thereby reducing time and cost of maintenance. In order to link your CSS file into your webpage use `<link rel="stylesheet" href="path/to/your/css/file.css">` within the `<head>` element.

CSS file
```css
/*This file is located under a CSS folder and the file name is style.css*/
h1 {
    text-decoration: underline;
    font-family: 'Arial', sans-serif;
}
```

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
    <head>
        <title>Adding CSS using style element</title>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css"/>
    </head>
    <body>
        <h1>The <!DOCTYPE> declaration is not an HTML tag; it is an instruction to the web browser about what version of HTML the page is written in.</h1>
    </body>
</html>
```
> The required rel attribute specifies the relationship between the current document and the linked document/resource.

The three major selector we will cover today is `type selector`, `id`, and `class`.
The `type selector` matches the element name used on HTML minus the `< >`. For example if you have `<a href="#">link</a>` then the selector would be:
```css
a {
    /*declarations*/
}

````

`Id` selector is used for unique elements which mean that the `id` can only be used **one time** per page loaded. Simply add an id attribute and the name of the desired id like so: <div id="mario"></div>. In order to select that element in CSS, you would need the same id name and the prefix symbol `#`
```css
#mario { 
    /*declarations */
}

```

And finally the `class` selector is very similar to the `id`selector, but `class` can be shared with two or more elements. Just add the `class attribute` to the element <div class="luigi"></div>. The CSS selector is the same name and the prefix of `.` (dot/period)
```css
.luigi { 
    /*declaration*/
}
```

### Elaborate
Create three HTML pages and link the pages to each other using `<a>`. Each page should have one paragraph with filler text.

Add an in-line style to the p element on each page.
