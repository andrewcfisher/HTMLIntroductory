# Project Launch

Now that we have covered the core concepts, we are ready to start building our first website. We will start from scratch, creating the folder structure, adding HTML and CSS files, and then start writing code.

It is very important that you choose a site type: organization, company, or personal site. Gather as much information and images as you can; they will help us to create the website. Having real content instead of using lorem ipsum and gray images makes a difference in the final product.

## Project Structure

We will not start out with a particular framework; we will instead put into practice the core concepts of HTML and CSS we've learned and see for ourselves of what can be done. This is going to be very exciting!

The project will be structured with the following format:

### Menu

The menu will consist of the name of the organization/company/product you have chosen and four links to different sections on the page. So think of at least 4 different elements you want to add to your website.

### Section

Each section of your organization/company/product will include the content you collected. The order of each section is irrelevant but I'd recommend having the landing section first as it will serve as a first impression when a person visits the page.

#### Landing section

Here we will be adding a picture of the organization/company/product, along with a title, subtitle and a button. The idea is to tell in a few words what the organization/company/product is all about.

#### Welcome/About section

In this section we will be adding more information for the visitor about the organization/company/product that could not be addressed on the landing page. We are going to use a single image and maybe two or three paragraphs.
 
#### Column section

Here we are going to describe the benefits of using a product, provide a brief synopsis of the programs that an organization has, or highlight the main services of the company you choose.

#### Events/Activities

The main purpose of this section is to showcase events or activities the company or organization is offering to the community.

#### Call to Action

Call to action is a term used for elements in the website that require user interaction. The most common are buttons (e.g. "Buy it Now!") or leads to a web page with additional information (e.g. "Donate" or "Learn more...").

## Working in class

There will be a total of 4 classes devoted to this project. Each day we will focus on solving the issues that arise with each section. Landing and Welcome will be done in a single day since those sections are the easiest ones. As we are working along during these days, we will put into practice what we have learned, so I recommend you review the past three weeks before coming to class. 

## Wireframe

Here is the wireframe we will be using to create our project. Feel free to arrange those sections to meet your needs.
