# Elaborate for Class 5
### Here is a navigation:
```html
<nav>
	<div>
		<a href="index.html">Home</a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a href="about.html">About Us</a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a href="services.html">Services</a>
	</div>

	<div>
		<a href="contact.html">Contact</a>
	</div>
</nav>
```

Align the nav to the right by giving it an ID.
Give each div the same class.
By referencing the div, make the anchor elements have the following:
* A left margin of 10 pixels.
* A padding top and bottom of 5 pixels.
* A padding left and right of 10 pixels.

Give the divs a background color of your choice.
Make the text for the anchor a color to go along with the divs' background color.
Extra points! select the first anchor element and take out the left margin
( hint: use the :nth-child() selector )
