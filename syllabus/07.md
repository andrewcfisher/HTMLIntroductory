# Instruction Plan

### Engage

You have survived three weeks of core knowledge on HTML and CSS, congratulation. Now, let's use that knowledge and start creating websites. Repetition is the key of getting better at everything and building websites is not the exception.

You have noticed that we dont have many options when it comes to select a font, we pretty much have the [CSS Web Safe Font](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_websafe_fonts.asp) for us to work with and to be honest it is very limited. Let's find out how we can add more according to our needs.

Have you noticed even though you add no CSS to your webpage things comes with a default style. The `user agent` is providing styles to elements and sometimes is good but sometimes we want to have a maximum control over elements and how we are modifying them. There is pretty cool set of CSS rules used for many developer that will help us to gain that control.


### Explore

Explore any website and inspect any element that has a font that you might think is unusual. Find out how it has been added.
