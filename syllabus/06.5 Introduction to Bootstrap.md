# Introduction to Boostrap

Bootstrap is one of the most popular frameworks for developing responsive websites. We will introduce Bootstrap this week so we can build [responsive](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Responsive_web_design) sites. To be more specific, we will build our site again but this time using this framework focus on mobile first.

## Getting started

To get started, download the [zip file](https://github.com/twbs/bootstrap/releases/download/v3.3.4/bootstrap-3.3.4-dist.zip). This zip file has 3 folders: CSS, js, and fonts.

![Bootstrap folders](/images/bootstrap-folders.jpg)

Inside the CSS folder you will find six files, but we will only use `bootstrap.min.css`.

Inside the js folder you will find 3 files, but we will only use `bootstrap.min.js`.

For the fonts, we are not going to use them but if you wish to know more, visit this [page](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#glyphicons).

All you have to do is copy those files into your project's css and js folder.

## What we will cover in Bootstrap

Certainly there is a lot to talk about Bootstrap. It is a very extensive topic and I hope after this course you have the confidence to go back and learn the rest of the components Bootstrap has to offer. We will concentrate on learning the grid system, responsive utilities, and navigation. These three components will allow us to manipulate the elements on the website and target to different screen sizes. Bootstrap also changes the appearance of the rest of the HTML elements (e.g. h1, ul, button, etc) but we can gain the control by using a custom css file and adjusting things to our needs.

### Grid system

Bootstrap includes a responsive, mobile first fluid grid system that appropriately scales up to 12 columns according to the screen size. Grid systems are used for creating page layouts through a series of rows and columns that holds the content.

We will be making two distinctions: phone(sx) and everything above that such as tablet(sm), laptop(md) and desktops(lg). Now since we have 12 columns in our grid, we can make several combinations that add up to 12, for example:

```html
<!-- It is important to have a column combination encapsulated within a row to perform well -->
<!-- This will result in 3 columns. First one is 4 column, second 2 column, and third 6 column wide -->
<!-- The total of these columns adds up to 12 -->
<div class="row">
    <div class="col-sm-4">
        This is 4 columns wide
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-2">
        This is 2 columns wide
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-6">
        This is 6 columns wide
    </div>
</div>
```

Here is the result:

By determining the number of columns for a specific screen size, all the other screen sizes bigger than the one described will inherat that size and all the smaller sized screens will be default to a 12 column width. When you define a container element like a `div` with `class=col-sm-4`, you are setting a container 4 columns wide for small, medium, and large screen sizes and for extra small screens, it will be 12 columns wide or full width.  Dont worry if this is too complex just by reading it because we will be covering this in class.

If you wish to learn more on your own time you can go and read the documentation [here](http://getbootstrap.com/css/#grid) and bring your questions to class.

### Responsive Utility

The use of this class of utilities will allow us to show or hide content/elements according the device specified. For example you can set a content/element to show only on a mobile phone and be hidden when the device is bigger or showing something only for big screens that is hidden for tablets/phones. You can use `.visible-*` or `.hidden_*` when `*` could be xs, sm, md, or lg which represents the size of the screen.

### Navigation

We will be using the Bootstrap navigation menu that  allows links on the page. This navigation is responsive. Bootstrap website has an example but I find it a bit complex to understand and it has more than what we need in our project, so I came with a simpler version of the navigation that we will be using in our project; take a look:

```html
<nav class="navbar navbar-default navbar-fixed-top" role="navigation">
          <div class="container">
            <div class="navbar-header">
              <button type="button" class="navbar-toggle collapsed" data-toggle="collapse" data-target="#example-navbar-collapse">
                <span class="sr-only">Toggle navigation</span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
                <span class="icon-bar"></span>
              </button>
              <a class="navbar-brand" href="#">Brand</a>
            </div>

            <!-- Collect the nav links for toggling -->
            <div class="collapse navbar-collapse" id="example-navbar-collapse">
              <ul class="nav navbar-nav">
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <a href="#">Link</a>
                </li>
              </ul> 
            </div><!-- /.navbar-collapse -->
          </div><!-- /.container -->
        </nav>
```
As you can see there are several containers and classes that bootstrap uses. Don't worry too much about understanding every single one of them, just know the basics of how works.
