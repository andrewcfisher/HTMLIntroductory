#HTML - HyperText Markup Language

This first week we will discover what a website is mainly made of and how the content it's structured. We will create html files, write code on them, and see how the browser interprets it.

We understand that HTML stands for HyperText Markup Language and I want to emphasis on what markup mean in a website context. In easy words; it is a set of characters that differ from regular text to write a document.

In this example I am showing you one of the basic HTML tags used to create a website the `<p>...</p>` tag. Pay close attention to the basic anatomy of this tag because one the common mistakes we make is forgetting to close a tag or missing parts of it.

>For example if I wrote this `<p This is a paragraph </p>`, I can say "on the opening tag the right bracket is missing" and you should be able to identify what is wrong with it.

If you want to dive in and see that other available HTML tag are out there, please review this page on [3wSchools](http://www.w3schools.com/tags/default.asp)
