# Instruction Plan

### Engage

Your website can import and link to multiple external style sheets. In the process, it is quite possible that some rules will conflict with one another. CSS uses a machanism called the `cascade` to resolve any such conflicts and arrive at a final set of styles to be applied to the document. Two key components of the cascade are `inheritance` and `specificty`.

We learned the three basic CSS selectors in the previous class, but there are more CSS selectors that will come in handy in the process of writing a website. Imagine adding classes and id's to every single element in order to be able to modify it as you will. The code will contain more information than it should since many of those attributes can be done using different CSS selection type. We need to find ways that are less restrictive to changes.

### Explore
Guess what, you will need the developer tool again. Open one of your favorite website and inspect any element, check the right panel and pay attention to the CSS selector listed there.

* What CSS selector do you recognize? 
* Do you see any special character on any selector?

Notice how some declarations are getting overwritten, because they are strikethrough. That means that at some point a CSS rule was applied to the element but then another rule came along and overwrite the previous one.

### Explain/Elaborate

#### CSS Precedence

**Inheritance** - The elements on your website form a treelike hierachy with the root element at the top and the rest of the document structure spreading down below it. 

**Class Discussion**

Example:

```html
<style>
    div {
        font-size: 30px;
        color: red;
    }
</style>

<body>
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is inheriting the rules from div element</p>
    </div>
</body>
```

**Specificity** - Describes the weight of a selector and any declarations associated with it.

<table>
        <tr>
            <th>Selector type</th>
            <th>Example</th>
            <th>Specificity</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Universal Selector</td>
            <td>*</td>
            <td>0,0,0,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Type Selector</td>
            <td>div</td>
            <td>0,0,0,1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Class Selector</td>
            <td>.luigi</td>
            <td>0,0,1,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ID selector</td>
            <td>#mario</td>
            <td>0,1,0,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Inline</td>
            <td>style="color:#ccc;"</td>
            <td>1,0,0,0</td>
        </tr>
</table>

Specifity values are cumulatives. A selector containing two type selector and a class selector `div.action p` has a spedificty of (0,0,1,2).
A selector containing 11 type selector (0,0,0,11) has a lower specoficity than a class selector (0,0,1,0).


**Last Rule** - When selectors have the same weight the last rule is applied.

#### CSS Selectors

Let's take a look to some othere form of CSS selector I want you to familiarize.


**Descendant Selector** - Matches an element that is a descendant of another specified element. This applies to all level of descendant.

```css
    body h1 {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    section .warning p {
        /*declarations*/
    }
```

**Child Selector** - Matches an element that is a direct child of another. It will not include grandchild and down. It is more restrictive than descendant selector

```css
    body > h1 {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    section > .warning {
        /*declarations*/
    }
```

**Pseudo-class Selector** - It is used to define a special state of an element. There are many Pseudo-classes available. Let's take a look to some of the most common used: first-child/last-child, hover, nth-child(n), and visited.

```css
    a.bowser:hover {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    article h2:first-child {
        /*declarations*/
    }
    
    section#kirby div:nth-child(2) {
         /*declarations*/
    }
```

There is a extensive list other selector and possible combinations to work with. Please refer to this [link](http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp) to see them all

### Evaluate

Make the paragraph and list items to have a color #9934df, font weight as blod, and font size 3 em using `Inheritance`.

```html
<section>
    <p>PlayStation consoles</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PlayStation 1 - 1995</li>
        <li>PlayStation 2 - 2000</li>
        <li>PlayStation 3 - 2006</li>
        <li>PlayStation 4 - 2013</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```

Get the specificity of the following selector

* div#mario p
* main section li
* <a style="text-decoration:nonel">Link</a>
* ul.important 
* section article h2.header
* *.liugi
* #yoshi p span.italic

Arrange the following in order from most specific to least specific.

`.my_div, div, #my_navigation, div > div`

How can you improve this snippet?

```html
    <!-- Make sure this CSS code goes in a external file inside a css folder -->
    <style>
        h1 {
            color: #ccc;
        }
        
        p {
            color: #ccc;
        }
    </style>
    
    <aside>
        <h1>Introducing Brotli: a new compression algorithm for the internet</h1>
        <div>
            <p>At Google, we think that internet users’ time is valuable, and that they shouldn’t have to wait long for a web page to load. Because fast is better than slow, two years ago we published the Zopfli compression algorithm. This received such positive feedback in the industry that it has been integrated into many compression solutions, ranging from PNG optimizers to preprocessing web content. Based on its use and other modern compression needs, such as web font compression, today we are excited to announce that we have developed and open sourced a new algorithm, the Brotli compression algorithm.</p>
            <p>While Zopfli is Deflate-compatible, Brotli is a whole new data format. This new format allows us to get 20–26% higher compression ratios over Zopfli. In our study ‘Comparison of Brotli, Deflate, Zopfli, LZMA, LZHAM and Bzip2 Compression Algorithms’ we show that Brotli is roughly as fast as zlib’s Deflate implementation. At the same time, it compresses slightly more densely than LZMA and bzip2 on the Canterbury corpus. The higher data density is achieved by a 2nd order context modeling, re-use of entropy codes, larger memory window of past data and joint distribution codes. Just like Zopfli, the new algorithm is named after Swiss bakery products. Brötli means ‘small bread’ in Swiss German.</p>
        </div>

### Homework

Oh no, someone messed with my code! Please help me out to get it back the way it was before. Gladly they didn't make any changes to my HTML, but my CSS is broken. Please, help me.
