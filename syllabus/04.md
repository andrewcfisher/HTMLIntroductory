**missing rule cascade**

# Instruction Plan

### Engage

Your website can import and link to multiple external style sheets. In the process, it is quite possible that some rules will conflict with one another. CSS uses a machanism called the `cascade` to resolve any shuc conflicts and arrive at a final set of styles to be applied to the document. Two key components of the cascade are `inheritance` and `specificty`.

We learned the three basic CSS selectors in the previous class, but there are more CSS selectors that will come in handy in the process of writing a website. Imagine adding classes and id's to every single element in order to be able to modify it as you will. The code will contain more information than it should since many of those attributes can be done using different CSS selection type. We need to find ways that are less restrictive to changes.

### Explore
Guess what, you will need the developer tool again. Open one of your favorite website and inspect any element, check the right panel and pay attention to the CSS selector listed there.

* What CSS selector do you recognize? 
* Do you see any special character on any selector?

Notice how some declarations are getting overwritten, because they are strikethrough. That means that at some point a CSS rule was applied to the element but then another rule came along and overwrite the previous one.

### Explain

One day will ask yourself, why is it not changing? or, Why is it changing? I am referring to styles that are being applied to certain elements. CSS rules cascade throughout your HTML document affecting your elements and sometines it does or doesnâ€™t do things we are asking for. Let's take the premises that the selects on CSS have a `weight`. The heavier the weight the more predominant the rules applied and when two or more rules have the `same weight` the `last one` will persist. Assuming we are affecting the same property with different values.

For example, single type selectors have the same weight which means that the last rule is applied.

```html
<style>
    p {
        font-size: 10px;
    }
    
    /* Some CSS rules in between */
    
    p {
        font-size: 20px;
    }
</style>

<p>How big would I be, 10 pixels or 20 pixels?</p>

```
**exercise using two style sheets**

Classes have more weight that type selector. So regardless if a type selector runs on an element, that element will have a style defined on that class.
example code
exercise
Id's have more weight than classes and type selector. So regardless if a type class or selector runs on a element, that element will have a style defined on that id.
example code
exercise
Also combinations of types and classes selected have weight. The more specific on your selection the more weight the selector would have. ul li is greater than li by itself

Let's take a look to some of the CSS selector I want you to familiarize.
Descendant Selector - Matches an element that is a descendant of another specified element. This applies to all level of descendant.
example code
exercise
Child Selector - Matches an element that is a direct child of another. It will not include grandchild and down.
example code
exercise
Attribute Selector - It is used to select element with a specific attribute. This attribute might or might not have a value depending on how you dictate it.
example code without value
exercise
example code with value
exercise
There is a extensive list of possible combinations to work with attribute="value". Please refer to it here http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp
Pseudo-class Selector - It is used to define a special state of an element. There are many Pseudo-classes available. Let's take a look to some of the most common used: first-child/last-child, hover, nth-child(n), and visited. Pseudo-classes are combined with other selectors. For example, I am going to select all even child from a li that is descendant from a p element.

### Elaborate

### Evaluate
Copy this code snippet to work on CSS selectors
code snippet
Make changes to li using descendant selector, applying the following style: 
Make changes to div's element that using direct child applying the following style:
Make changes only to the first p using descendant select and pseudo-class applying the following style:

### Homework
Oh no, someone messed with my code! Please help me out to get it back the way it was before. Gladly they didn't make any changes to my HTML, but my CSS is broken. Please, help me.
