**missing rule cascade**

# Instruction Plan

### Engage

Your website can import and link to multiple external style sheets. In the process, it is quite possible that some rules will conflict with one another. CSS uses a machanism called the `cascade` to resolve any shuc conflicts and arrive at a final set of styles to be applied to the document. Two key components of the cascade are `inheritance` and `specificty`.

We learned the three basic CSS selectors in the previous class, but there are more CSS selectors that will come in handy in the process of writing a website. Imagine adding classes and id's to every single element in order to be able to modify it as you will. The code will contain more information than it should since many of those attributes can be done using different CSS selection type. We need to find ways that are less restrictive to changes.

### Explore
Guess what, you will need the developer tool again. Open one of your favorite website and inspect any element, check the right panel and pay attention to the CSS selector listed there.

* What CSS selector do you recognize? 
* Do you see any special character on any selector?

Notice how some declarations are getting overwritten, because they are strikethrough. That means that at some point a CSS rule was applied to the element but then another rule came along and overwrite the previous one.

### Explain

#### CSS Precendence

**Inheritance** - The elements on your website form a treelike hierachy with the root element at the top and the rest of the document structure spreading down below it. 
**Class Discussion**

Example:

```html
<style>
    div {
        font-size: 30px;
        color: red;
    }
</style>

<body>
    <div>
        <p>This paragraph is inheriting the rules from div element</p>
    </div>
</body>
```

**Specificity** - Describes the weight of a selector and any declarations associated with it.

<table>
    <thead>
        <th>
            <td>Selector type</td>
            <td>Example</td>
            <td>Specificity</td>
        </th>
    </thead>
    <tbody>
        <tr>
            <td>Universal Selector</td>
            <td>*</td>
            <td>0,0,0,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Type Selector</td>
            <td>div</td>
            <td>0,0,0,1</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Class Selector</td>
            <td>.luigi</td>
            <td>0,0,1,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>ID selector</td>
            <td>#mario</td>
            <td>0,1,0,0</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>Inline</td>
            <td>style="color:#ccc;"</td>
            <td>1,0,0,0</td>
        </tr>
    </tbody>
</table>

Specifity values are cumulatives. A selector containing two type selector and a class selector `div.action p` has a spedificty of 0,0,1,2.
A selector containing 11 type selector (0,0,0,1) has a lower specoficity than a class selector (0,0,1,0).


**Last Rule** - When selectors have the same weight the last rule is applied.

#### CSS Selectors

Let's take a look to some othere form of CSS selector I want you to familiarize.


**Descendant Selector** - Matches an element that is a descendant of another specified element. This applies to all level of descendant.

example code
exercise
Child Selector - Matches an element that is a direct child of another. It will not include grandchild and down.
example code
exercise
Attribute Selector - It is used to select element with a specific attribute. This attribute might or might not have a value depending on how you dictate it.
example code without value
exercise
example code with value
exercise
There is a extensive list of possible combinations to work with attribute="value". Please refer to it here http://www.w3schools.com/css/css_attribute_selectors.asp
Pseudo-class Selector - It is used to define a special state of an element. There are many Pseudo-classes available. Let's take a look to some of the most common used: first-child/last-child, hover, nth-child(n), and visited. Pseudo-classes are combined with other selectors. For example, I am going to select all even child from a li that is descendant from a p element.

### Elaborate

Make the paragraph and list items to have a color #9934df, font weight as blod, and font size 3 em using `Inheritance`.

```html
<section>
    <p>PlayStation consoles</p>
    <ul>
        <li>PlayStation 1 - 1995</li>
        <li>PlayStation 2 - 2000</li>
        <li>PlayStation 3 - 2006</li>
        <li>PlayStation 4 - 2013</li>
    </ul>
</section>
```

Get the specificity of the following selector

* div#mario p
* main section li
* <a style="text-decoration:nonel">Link</a>
* ul.important 
* section article h2.header
* *.liugi
* #yoshi p span.italic

### Homework
Oh no, someone messed with my code! Please help me out to get it back the way it was before. Gladly they didn't make any changes to my HTML, but my CSS is broken. Please, help me.
