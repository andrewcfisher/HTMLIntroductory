#More Bootstrap!

Only need two basic files to make bootstrap work:

bootstrap.min.css and bootstrap.min.js

Things to know:

container-fluids
rows
columns
offestting
push/pull
hidden/visible


Break Points:

xs < 767px
768px < sm < 991px
md > 991px

.visible-^-% and .hidden-^

^ denotes xs, sm, md, or lg
% denotes the display property you wish to set (block, inline, or inline-block)

*USEFUL TIDBIT*

the css styles of display and visible are COMPLETELY DIFFERENT; although the content disappears in both.

whenever you set the display to none, it removes the content from the document flow.

However, when you set the visibility to hidden, it simply doesn't show that element, but it'll still take up the some amount of space.

*END OF USEFUL BIT OF TID*
