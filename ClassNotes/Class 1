 How the internet Works
 Client (your pc) talks to other computers through protocols using an inter-network(the internet).
 Each device has its own IP address that is unique. 
 Those internal computers, when they want to talk to other things outside of your house, need to connect to the ISP(internet service provider)
 Those ISPs are all connected to the internet cables
 Web servers are directly connected into that cable, skipping the ISPs but not the IP. 
 Everything is broken down into chunks of data and sent from the server to your client when you make that request.
 Every address on the internet (i.e. www.google.com) is actually a series numbers. 
 When you go to the address, the browser requests from the operating system to go to that address.
 The operating system uses the resolve name server (RNS) to go out to the closest root (physical location).
 The root then goes to the registry (godaddy.com, bluehost, etc).
 The words of the address then gets translated to the actual numbers of the address.

Must structure a new element with <> and </> 
example:  <p>This will be displayed as a paragraph.</p>
There are many elements, some have different attributes like the "img" element
( it is structured like this:  <img src="yourimage.com" /> ) 
 
 Talked about the different elements to start a new html file.
 The five things you need to start a new html file are:
 <!DOCTYPE html>
 <html>
 <head> <title>Page Title</title> </head>
 <body></body>
 </html>
