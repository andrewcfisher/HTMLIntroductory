Class 2 - 9/16/2015

PJ and Samantha showed us their homework websites.

A little bit about tables:
a table in html is a way to structure information on a page.
ALWAYS starts with a <table>
inside that, you have <tr> or table rows.
inside those rows, you have <td> or table data.

Here is a functional example:
<table>
  <tr>
    <td>Jill</td>
    <td>Smith</td>		
    <td>50</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Eve</td>
    <td>Jackson</td>		
    <td>94</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>John</td>
    <td>Doe</td>		
    <td>80</td>
  </tr>
</table>

There is also the <th> element which stands for table header.
More information on tables here:  http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_tables.asp

From personal experience, tables are good for only one thing: html emails.
There are much better, more efficient ways to structure the layout of your site without tables.

Element Structure
<a href="www.facebook.com" target="_blank">This is a link to Facebook!</a>
a = element
href and target = attributes
www.facebook.com and _blank = values

ALL VALUES ^ MUST COME IN BETWEEN QUOTES 

Semantic Elements
The have meaning to the layout of the page and to the browser.
For example: the <nav> element connotates "navigation" ; however,
the <nav> and <div> elements do not technically differ, they are containers.
This is also true for the <main>, <section>, <aside>, <footer>,and <article> elements.

Everyone practiced replacing the id's of the elements with their semantic equivalents.
A big note here, a lot of the problems experienced here were the result of very small errors,
meaning we must be very careful when coding our sites (closing tags, nesting correctly, etc.)

For the homework, make sure to delete only the "css/" words inside the <link> element.
Header > Nav
Main > Section > Article > Aside
Footer
